Two sum is my favorite warm up question for a coding interview. Its easy to explain and easy to solve and there aren't too many clarifying questions that need to be asked. Its one that you can just jump into.

## The challenge

Given an array of integers and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers that sum to the target. Each input shall have but one solution.

## Examples

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

## The Solution

Our goal is to determine if there are two numbers that sum to a target. If we iterate over each value in the array we can derive the complimentary number by subtracting it from the target. If our target is 9 and our current value is 2, then the other number we're looking for is 7. Now we just need a quick way to determine if the compliment is present in the array and, if so, its index.

We can utilize a hash map to store all values in the array and perform quick O(1) lookups. We can complete the solution in a single pass. If we miss the first value of the solution we'll store it in the hash and retrieve it when we come upon its complement later in the array.

``` python
import pytest


class Solution:

    # Runs at O(n) time and O(n) space
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        hash_nums = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            compliment = target - num
            if compliment in hash_nums:
                return [hash_nums[compliment], i]
            hash_nums[num] = i

@pytest.mark.parametrize("nums,target,expected", [
    ([3,2,4], 6, [1,2]),
    ([2, 7, 11, 15], 9, [0, 1])
])
class TestClass:
    def test_simple_case(self, nums, target, expected):
        s = Solution()
        assert s.twoSum(nums, target) == expected
```
