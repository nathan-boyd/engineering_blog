A brief review of _Soft Skills: The software developer's life manual 1st Edition_

Soft Skills, written by John Sonmez, aims to capture the aspects of software engineering that extend beyond the command line and the IDE. Sonmez provides council on the following:
- Career - Active career management.
- Marketing - (Yourself).
- Learning - Continuing education through a hands-on approach.
- Productivity - Do the work.
- Financial - A primer on fiscal intelligence.
- Fitness - Physical health and where it fits in the Software Development Life cycle.
- Spirit - Mastery of self.

Many of these topics feel familiar. Sonmez pulls concepts from How to Win Friends & Influence People, The Power of Positive Thinking, and other popular self-improvement books. He doesn't claim to possess secret knowledge or discoveries; he catalogs and consolidates what is already helping people and packages it in such a way as to help code monkeys like me. Herein lies the value; it's the application of common betterment principles to our domain.

Some of these applications include
- Keeping a log of daily activities
- Turning daily log into weekly summary to send to the manager
- Giving presentations on challenges the team is facing
- Developing and Maintaining the professional mindset
- Time management
- Saying No
- Developing positive habits
- Fake it til you make it
- Marketing your value
- The importance of presence
- Productivity techniques
- Dealing with failure

It's a quick read; I think it took me about a week of casual commitment to wrap it up. For that kind of investment, I'd say it's worthwhile. I'll be starting a new role soon, and a book like this was what I needed to hit the ground running.
