A brief review of _Soft Skills: The software developer's life manual 1st Edition_

![Soft Skills: The software developer's life manual 1st Edition](/img/posts/soft-skills/soft-skills-cover.png)

Soft Skills, written by John Sonmez, aims to capture the aspects of software engineering that extend beyond the command line and the IDE. Sonmez provides council on the following:
- Career - Active career management.
- Marketing Yourself.
- Learning - Continuing education through a hands-on approach.
- Productivity - Do the work.
- Financial - A primer on fiscal intelligence.
- Fitness - Physical health and where it fits in the Software Development Life cycle.
- Spirit - Mastery of self.

Many of these topics feel familiar. Sonmez quotes from How to Win Friends & Influence People, The Power of Positive Thinking, and other popular self-improvement books. He can distill many of those concepts into applications that are practical to Software Engineering practitioners. Herein lies the value, it's the application of common betterment principles to our domain.

Its a quick read, I think it took me about a week of casual commitment to wrap it up. For that kind of investment I'd say its worthwhile.
